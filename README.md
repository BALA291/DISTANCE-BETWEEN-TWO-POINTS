# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Get the two list from the user.
### Step 2: 
Import the math module.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the value using the foemat function.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
  ```

import math
l1 = [4,2]
l2 = [10,6]
distance = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```

### OUTPUT:
![p1 c](https://github.com/BALA291/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/120717501/0b02524e-bd6f-47a7-89c6-12dbff51b246)


### RESULT:
Thus the difference between two points is found.
